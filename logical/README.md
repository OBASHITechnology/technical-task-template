## The Offices

Below is a small section of an Obashi B&IT diagram taken from the ownership layer. 

The diagram snippet represents two offices within an organisation, London and Glasgow with a total of four employees. Anthony divides his 
time between both offices and manages Megan and Peter in the London office while managing Karen in the Glasgow office.

## Task 

Below are three scenarios involving the diagram above. For each list the **logical** steps involved in answering the question and how 
this could be done programmatically. The output should be in a file called `ANSWERS.md` and live in the same directory as this file. Any supporting resources 
should be placed into `resources` directory. 

example

```text
//find which offices Anthony works at (this is crude - just an example)

1 inspect each office element in turn 
2 if the office <some condition> record it as a workplace
3 all recorded results <some result>

//programmatic 

Step 1 can be automated by...
The condition in step 2...
Step 3 could be improved by...

```

### Questions

1. The company owner wishes to know who works at the London office.
   
2. To boost skills the company is looking to cross train people who are co-located. Peter is familiar with Sage - who could he train?

3. As part of a company wide initiative the owner would like to acquaint employees who work in physically different locations - if Karen 
starts a video call who else should be on it?

Are there any common patterns or reusable logic in your answers?

# Obashi Technical 

The technical task is broken down into two segments consisting of 

* [Logical](logical/README.md) - using an obashi partial B&IT and looking closer at the logic therein 
* [Code](code/README.md) - writing a simple Blob Storage server in Go.

We suggest dividing your time 1/3 to the logical portion and the 2/3 to the code portion. In total you should spend no more than 
3 hours on this task set. 

## How to submit 

Once you're happy with your submissions simply commit the code and create a PR (base master). Once reviewed we'll get back to you!

Good Luck!
